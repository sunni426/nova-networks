## Software Setup

### Training Mode

To run basic training workflow, please run the following command. Input argument ```-i``` specifies directory that will store the contents of this command, in ```results```. Input argument ```-j``` specifies configuration file (YAML file). ```main-training.ipynb``` and ```main-testing.ipynb``` provide an example for training and testing modalities.
```
!python main.py train -i save_directory -j options/nova.yaml
```
For custom configurations:
> configs/options/nova.yaml (For specific configurations, including ground truth and input paths, training configs)
> 
> configs/__init__.py (For all other default configurations)

Ground truth csv files are stored as .csv files in:
> dataloaders/split

Please use the packages in the following requirements file to configure virtual environment configuration:
> novaenv_requirements.txt

- **Run Training:**
  ```bash
  !python main.py train -i save_directory -j options/nova.yaml
  ```
- Update configuration file setup for custom model options, including directory paths to training, validation, and testing csv's.
- Initialize separate ```basic_train``` and ```dataloaders/datasets``` for different datasets. Key parameters to be adjusted include:
  - Number of labels to predict
  - Normalization values and other custom transform functions
  - Fixed number of cells to load in per image
- Specify model class (including EfficienNet, Resnet, MedViTs) in ```models``` folder, can implement additional model classes.
- **Note**: Training utilities:
  - Save model weights of best epoch checkpoint
  - Keep a running log of losses and metrics: mean average precision (mAP) and area under the curve (AUC)
  - Save final predictions (weighted image-level and cell-level predictions) and corresponding ground truth as csv's in the ```results``` directory.
- **Note**: MAE pretraining & subsequent ViT finetuning separately trained, not using weighted image-cell level dual head predictor skeleton. Please refer to ```Nova-Classifier/mae.ipynb``` notebook for training details.

- The two datasets we trained on are:
  - Human Protein Atlas (HPA), https://www.proteinatlas.org/
  - Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC036) Human U2OS Cells â€“ profiling bioactive compounds using Cell Painting, https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC036

### Testing mode
- **Run Testing:**
  ```bash
  !python main.py test -i save_directory -j options/nova.yaml
  ```
- Generates gradcam in ```log``` directory of training results folder for every class.
- Outputs class predictions
- Calculates metrics (mAP) for the best model checkpoint on the testing dataset, which is chosen by the highest mAP during training.

### Version Compatibility
* To run this codebase, please configure packages to the versions in ```novaenv_requirements.txt```.
* Training supported on GPUs P100, V100, A40, and higher versions.

## Data Preprocessing

To run preprocessing for the HPA and BBBC datasets, please follow the instructions provided in the ```preproc_bbbc.ipynb``` and ```preproc_HPA.ipynb``` in the ```preprocessing``` folder.
